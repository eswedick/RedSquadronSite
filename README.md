The goal of the site is to be a one stop shop to assist new and existing users with interacting with the media server.

There are two services users will interact with:
  Overseerr to submit media requests.
  Plex for video streaming.
Providing links to these services will make it easier for a new user to navigate the ecosystem.
  
Users can receive notifications from Overseerr when media is available, by connecting to a discord or telegram bot. This should be made as simple as possible.

For new users, they should be able to send an email request for a plex login and get a join link for discord server.
